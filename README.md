A category of information filtering systems are 
recommender systems. These systems are specialized 
software parts that are typically included in bigger software 
systems but may also be used independently. The primary 
objective of a recommender system is to offer the user 
software ideas for things that might be useful. The advice 
relates to many approaches for making decisions, such as 
which product to buy, which movie to watch, or which 
vacation to book. The initiative primarily aids in suggesting 
titles of films and television shows from various OTT 
platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and 
Hotstar. The project essentially unifies many 
recommendation systems onto a single platform.
